06:15 to
07:15   Anna and I woke up, and started brainstorming in bed.
08:00   We got out of bed and ate breakfast. I watched the Unity sprite tutorial and looked at other Ludum Dare dev's progress.
08:30   Got first sprite moving on-screen under keyboard control.
09:30   Enemy sprite follows player sprite. Display text on screen. Log to console. Added project to SVN.
09:30 to
12:30   Hill running, shower & lunch
13:00   Listened to some Ludum Dare YouTube videos.
13:20   Got player to follow mouse instead of via arrow keys.
13:20 to
14:50   Had a nap, brainstormed, had a coffee.
15:30   Mucked about with Unity 2D colliders. They appear not to work!
15:45   Got player to collide with collectible, which then destroys the collectible.
16:15   Created a prefab for collectibles. When player collects one, another is created from the prefab.
16:45 to
17:00   Chatted to Anna about her work
17:10   New collectibles are always created within a 2D rectangle defined by a (disabled) BoxCollider2D. This allows easy customisation of the spawn area.
17:10 to
17:50   Saved all work to SVN (including Scene!), restarted PC for anti-virus, mucked about with new cheap Android tablet.
19:15   Created a box to represent the air/sky. The player has only limited air, and must return to the surface to get more air, otherwise they die. Tried to stop the player flying through the air!
19:15 to
20:00   Had dinner
20:25   Prevented the player from flying through air. Instead the player bobs at the surface of the water.
20:50 to
21:10   Showed game to Anna and discussed game artwork.
22:10   Added bar showing level of oxygen, which refills slowly when player at surface. Spawn more collectibles only when player has picked some up.
22:50   Took Anna's artwork, made sprites have transparent backgrounds, published game to DropBox but couldn't be bothered to post to the Ludum Dare website.
